## Ants-vs-Bees
This is a game I made as one of my projects in Berkeley CS61A course. It is a game similar to Plants vs Zombies, but here they are ants and bees. Use python to run ants_gui to play the game. Unfortunately, since the course is over, we don't have the web interface now. You can still run it in a lame graphics though.
